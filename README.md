# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
* This is my assignment on Andrew Ng's special course  "[***Deep Learning Specialization***](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)" This special course consists of five courses: 
    * [***Neural Networks and Deep Learning***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome) Â 

    
* [***Neural Networks and Deep Learning***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome)
    * In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. When you finish this class, you will:
        * Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
        * Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
        * Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
        * Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 
          
    * Programming Assignments:
        * Python Basics with Numpy   [[notebook]](https://github.com/Kasiastw/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/notebook/Python%2BBasics%2BWith%2BNumpy.ipynb) 
        * Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset  [[notebook]](https://github.com/Kasiastw/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/notebook/Logistic%2BRegression%2Bwith%2Ba%2BNeural%2BNetwork%2Bmindset%2Bv5.ipynb)  
        * Planar data classification with one hidden layer   [[notebook]](https://github.com/Kasiastw/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/notebook/Planar%2Bdata%2Bclassification%2Bwith%2Bone%2Bhidden%2Blayer%2Bv5.ipynb)   
        * Building your Deep Neural Network Step by Step 
        * Deep Neural Network Application
